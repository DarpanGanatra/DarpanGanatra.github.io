This is a series of notebooks created mainly for myself. I have a difficult time remembering things, so I'll have a painful level of detail in some things. Let me know if there are errors or if you want to find out more about anything I haven't covered (or maybe I didn't cover it in as much detail as you'd like). You can reach me at my email: ganatradarpan@gmail.com
